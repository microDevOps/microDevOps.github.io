# Develop the first microservice
Developers can quickly build a project in two ways:

* Download the samples project. It is recommended to download the entire project, according to the example [SpringMVC] (https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/samples/springmvc-sample) or [JAX RS] (https: //github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/samples/jaxrs-sample) Initialize the configuration.

* Generate projects using archetypes

Before you start, developers need to choose a familiar development method. There are currently 3 ways to choose:
* Spring MVC
* JAX RS
* RPC

Their corresponding samples project are:
* [Spring MVC] (https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/samples/springmvc-sample)
* [JAX RS] (https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/samples/jaxrs-sample)
* [RPC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/samples/pojo-sample)
* Or use [archetypes] (https://github.com/apache/incubator-servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/archetypes)
